Types of blog posts that capture a lot of what we're going for:
* **Mini-tutorials**: Step-by-step instructions on how do something interesting that is of value to the community/audience (and why doing it is valuable).
* **Mini-experiments**: An explanation of an open-ended problem and some approaches you tried to solving it, accompanied by motivation and what worked and what didn't. See this post for an example of how one might support multi-word expressions in topic modeling as a good example: http://www.mimno.org/articles/phrases/ . Such experiments can be part of a larger series you're looking to conduct, and a good write up of what you've tried so far, what worked and what didn't, and what you look to do could make for an interesting post (and often will help you see the big picture).
* **Commentaries on research methods**: A discussion of how research is conducted and a description of open questions that need to be addressed.  See Hal's post on baselines for a good example: http://nlpers.blogspot.ca/2014/11/the-myth-of-strong-baseline.html . 
* **Expanded or Public-Accessible Summary of Your Publication**: This should be a 20,000 foot view of a research paper you wrote that is immediately accessible to someone with roughly a college-level education. Diagrams, motivation, and practical implications are a must. This type of post also offers a lot of room for speculation: what were the problems you encountered that you couldn't solve? What would you have done differently? If you had more resources, what would have been the next experiment to do and why?
* **Commentaries on papers**: what you enjoyed, problems you encountered when re-implementing them, open questions that you think need addressed but haven't been.This post could read like a story of what you learned as a part of working through the paper and the insights you had.
* **Conference summaries**: What talks you went to, which were your favorites, and what you learned. Capture what most excited you at the conference for those that weren't able to attend.
